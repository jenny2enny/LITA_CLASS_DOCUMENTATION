 **LITA_CLASS_DOCUMENTATION**

This is where I documented my first project while learning Data analysis with the Incubator  Hub.

**Project Title** :Microsoft Excel for Data Cleaning, Analysis and VIsualization.[Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

**Analysis Tool:** Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel.

A PivotTable in Microsoft Excel is a power tool for summarizing, analizing, exploring, and presenting large amount of data.

Here are keys to create and use a PivotTable:

**CREATING A PIVOT TABLE**

1. **Select Your Data:**

- Ensure your data set is organized in tabular format with heeaders (column names). Select any cell within the range of your data.

2. **Insert a PivotTable:**
- Go to **insert** tab on the Ribbon.
- Click on **PivotTable**.
- In the dialog box, confirm the data range and choose whether to place the PivotTable in the worksheet or an existing one.

3. **Set Up Your PivotTable:**
- Once the PivotTable Field List appears, you can drag and drop fields into four areas:
- **Filters:** To filter data based on spec
  ific criteria.
- **Columns:** TO display data in conlumns for comparisom.
- **Rows:** To  display data in rows.
- **Values:** To summarize data , such as by counting or summing.

  **WORKING WITH A PIVOT TABLE**
1. **Ajusting Fields:**
-You can modify the arrangement by dragging fields in and out of different areas to adjust the view according to your needs.

2. **Summarizinng Values:**
- In the value area, click on the drop-down of any field to change the summary calculation (Sum, Count, Average, etc.) by selecting **Value Field Settings**.

3. **Refreshing the PivotTable:**
- If your source data changes, right-click on the PivotTable and select **Refresh** to update the results.

4. **Formatting the PivotTable:**
- Use the **Design** tab under PivotTable Tool to change the style and format of the PivotTable for better presentation.

5. **Using Slicer:**
- For easier filtering, you can add slicers (found under the **Analze** tab) to provide a user-friendly way to filter your data quickly.
