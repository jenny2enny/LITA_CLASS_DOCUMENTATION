This is where I documented my first project while learning Data analysis with the Incubator  Hub.

**Project Title** :Microsoft Excel for Data Cleaning, Analysis and VIsualization.[Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com

**Analysis Tool:** Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel.

A PivotTable in Microsoft Excel is a power tool for summarizing, analizing, exploring, and presenting large amount of data.

Here are keys to create and use a PivotTable:

**CREATING A PIVOT TABLE**

- Ensure your data set is organized in tabular format with heeaders (column names). Select any cell within the range of your data.

2. **Insert a PivotTable:**
- Go to **insert** tab on the Ribbon.
- Click on **PivotTable**.
- In the dialog box, confirm the data range and choose whether to place the PivotTable in the worksheet or an existing one.

3. **Set Up Your PivotTable:**
- Once the PivotTable Field List appears, you can drag and drop fields into four areas:
- **Filters:** To filter data based on spec
  ific criteria.

  **WORKING WITH A PIVOT TABLE**

2. **Summarizinng Values:**

4. **Formatting the PivotTable:**

5. **Using Slicer:**
